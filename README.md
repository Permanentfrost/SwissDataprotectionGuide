# Basic Compliance Checklist

Use this checklist as a starting point. **Note: Chapters are sorted by importance.**

### 1. Record of Data Processing Activities

### Record of Data Processing Activities

According to Article 12 FADP, the company maintains a record of all data processing activities. Companies with more than 250 employees or those that process particularly sensitive personal data on a large scale or conduct profiling with a high risk are obliged to do so. However, it is strongly suggested to build up such an inventory nonetheless to have a certain level of overview.  

### Risk Assessment and Data Protection Impact Assessment

For data processing activities that are relevant to data protection and pose a high risk to data subjects, a data protection impact assessment must be carried out according to Article 22 FADP.

### Profiling

If profiling with a high risk is carried out, i.e., the linking of personal data from which personality traits of a person can be derived, the explicit consent of the data subjects must be obtained.

### Transfer of Personal Data Abroad

The lawful transfer of personal data to third countries may only take place in compliance with appropriate data protection standards or other legal bases. Article 16 paragraph 2 FADP regulates the conditions for transfers to third countries not listed in the list issued by the state.

### Processing of Personal Data Abroad

If a company has personal data processed by third parties, it is responsible for ensuring that the data processing complies with applicable data protection regulations. A data processing agreement is generally concluded for such processing.

### Technical and Organizational Measures

According to Article 8 FADP, suitable technical protection mechanisms and organizational processes (TOMS) must be established to minimize data protection risks and protect personal data.

These TOMS are (similar to the CIA-Triad) divided into the categories of confidentiality, availiabilty, integrity and traceability. 

>[!TIP]
>The **CIA** triad relates to **C**onfidentiality (restricting access to authorized individuals), **I**ntegrity (preventing unauthorized modifications), and **A**vailability (ensuring reliable access when needed).

This is further detailed in Art. 3 of the DPR: 

1. Confidentiality

    a. Authorized persons only have access to the personal data they need to perform their tasks (access control);
    b. Only authorized persons have access to the premises and facilities where personal data is processed (entry control);
    c. Unauthorized persons cannot use automated data processing systems via data transmission facilities (user control).

2. Availability and integrity

    a. Unauthorized persons cannot read, copy, alter, move, delete, or destroy data carriers (data carrier control);
    b. Unauthorized persons cannot store, read, modify, delete, or destroy personal data in the storage system (storage control);
    c. Unauthorized persons cannot read, copy, alter, delete, or destroy personal data during the disclosure of personal data or the transport of data carriers (transport control);
    d. The availability of personal data and access to it can be quickly restored in the event of a physical or technical incident (restoration);
    e. All functions of the automated data processing system are available (availability), malfunctions are reported (reliability), and stored personal data cannot be damaged by system malfunctions (data integrity);
    f. Operating systems and application software are always kept up to date with the latest security standards and known critical vulnerabilities are closed (system security).

3. Traceability

    a. It can be verified which personal data was entered or modified in the automated data processing system, at what time, and by whom (input control);
    b. It can be verified to whom personal data was disclosed using data transmission facilities (disclosure control);
    c. Data security breaches are quickly detected (detection) and measures are taken to mitigate or eliminate the consequences (elimination).


### Privacy by Default and Privacy by Design

When designing, developing, and upgrading IT systems, the principles of data protection and IT security must be integratively taken into account according to Article 7 FADP.

### Employee Training

Employees must be trained at appropriate intervals on data protection and data protection processes.

### Information Obligations

The company ensures that data subjects can obtain all relevant information about data processing according to Article 19 FADP. If a website is operated, the information obligation is usually fulfilled by a privacy policy published on the website.

### Right to Information/Data Disclosure

Data subjects can demand information and disclosure of their data according to Article 25 FADP. The company has an obligation to provide information, which also applies to contract data processing.

### Employees' Right to Information

Employees also have the right to information about the processing of their data in the company (information, correction, objection).

### Data Breaches

Employees must report violations of data protection to the responsible authority in the company as soon as possible. In the case of violations with expected high risk, immediate notification to the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) must be made, indicating the nature of the violation, its impact, and the measures taken or planned.
