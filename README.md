## Record of Data Processing Activities
According to Article 12 FADP, the company maintains a record of all data processing activities. Companies with more than 250 employees or those that process particularly sensitive personal data on a large scale or conduct profiling with a high risk are obliged to do so.

## Risk Assessment and Data Protection Impact Assessment
For data processing activities that are relevant to data protection and pose a high risk to data subjects, a data protection impact assessment must be carried out according to Article 22 FADP.

## Profiling
If profiling with a high risk is carried out, i.e., the linking of personal data from which personality traits of a person can be derived, the explicit consent of the data subjects must be obtained.

## Transfer of Personal Data Abroad
The lawful transfer of personal data to third countries may only take place in compliance with appropriate data protection standards or other legal bases. Article 16 paragraph 2 FADP regulates the conditions for transfers to third countries not listed in the list.

## Processing of Personal Data Abroad
If a company has personal data processed by third parties, it is responsible for ensuring that the data processing complies with applicable data protection regulations. A data processing agreement is generally concluded for such processing.

## Technical and Organizational Measures
According to Article 8 FADP, suitable technical protection mechanisms and organizational processes must be established to minimize data protection risks and protect personal data.

## Privacy by Default and Privacy by Design
When designing, developing, and upgrading IT systems, the principles of data protection and IT security must be integratively taken into account according to Article 7 FADP.

## Employee Training
Employees must be trained at appropriate intervals on data protection and data protection processes.

## Information Obligations
The company ensures that data subjects can obtain all relevant information about data processing according to Article 19 FADP. If a website is operated, the information obligation is usually fulfilled by a privacy policy published on the website.

## Right to Information/Data Disclosure
Data subjects can demand information and disclosure of their data according to Article 25 FADP. The company has an obligation to provide information, which also applies to contract data processing.

## Employees' Right to Information
Employees also have the right to information about the processing of their data in the company (information, correction, objection).

## Data Breaches
Employees must report violations of data protection to the responsible authority in the company as soon as possible. In the case of violations with expected high risk, immediate notification to the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) must be made, indicating the nature of the violation, its impact, and the measures taken or planned.
